# What is DSA (Data Structure and Algorithm)?
Data Structure: mean how data is structure or in simple words we can say how data is arrange or way of arranging data is called Data Structure. Examples: Array, Stack, Queue, Linklist, Tree

Algorithm: Approach of solving problem is called algorithm 

# Why DSA Matters?
- Efficient and fast program: To make our program fast and efficient 
If you use better approch and algorithm for coding then our program will be fast 
- Problem solving: DSA make our foundation strong help us to handle complex problem
- Compitional and technical interview: Many big companies focus on DSA intead of any framework

# Types of Data Structure and algorithm

Data Structure is Divided into Linear and Non-Linear

- Linear
- Non-Linear 

Linear Data Structure: Data arrange in sequence. Example: Array, Stack, Queue,Linked List

Non-Linear Data Structure: Where data is not arranged sequenctially. They arranged in hierachial manner. Example Tree and Graph.

## Types of Algorithm:
- Searching Algorithm: (Finding an item in data)
Linear Search, Binary Search
- Sorting Algorithm: (Arranging Data in order)
Bubble sort, Selection Sort, Quick sort, Merge Sort
- Graph Algorithm: (Solving Problem using graph)
- Dynamic Programming: (Solving problems storing past results)

## Various Linear Data Structure:

- Array: It is a collection of similar data types store at continous memory locations

Continous memory means memory is in continous order one after another which means all elements place each to other. Example: At school in assembly line same class student have seprate line which make easy to identify them

- Stack: It follows the LIFO (Last in first out) structure to stores the elements. It has two main operation push and pop 
Push means adding elements at top
Pop means the elements from the top
Example: Think like a Plate in wedding The plate which is on the top which picked first

- Queue: It follows the FIFO (First in First Out) to store the element. Its means the element added in first is removed first 
Example: Think like a Ticket line the one who come first will get Ticket first 

- Linked Link: Link list contain of a series of nodes which is connected to each to each other each nodes consist of data and its refrance which is pointer 

Types of Linklist
1) Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node
2) Doubly Linked List: Each node points previous node and next node
3) Circular Linked List: The last node point to first node make circle

## If we have array, list, tuple, dict then why we need linklist?

List, Array, Tuple, dict store data in countinous memory so all must be stores together but linked List uses non-continous memory and adding and deleting elements in slow but linked list slow this problem 

## If we have list, array, tuple and dict then why we need stack and queue?

It's depend on how we have we manage and arranged the efficiently if you want random access you can use list, tuple and dict but if you recticted the access and only want to add to remove element from the top

## Time Complexity and Space Complexity

Time Complexity: How much time is need to completing the algorithm 

Space Complexity: How much exta memory need other than input 

## Asymptotic Notations

Asymptotic Notations is a mathematical tool which tells how efficient is algorithm in terms of time and space complexity.

There is Various Types of Notations
- Big O Notation
- Theta Notation
- Omega Notation
- Little o Notation

Big O notation: Its tells the worst case scenario and Upper bound we mean that the algorithm will never take more time than a certain function g(n).

Some Common Big O notation:
Cubic Notation: O(n^3)
Quadratic Notation: O(n^2)
Factorial Notation: O(n!)

Theta Notaion: Avearge Case and Tight Bound It tells the average growth of the algorithm

Omega Notation: Best Case and Lower Bound Omega notation represents the best-case time complexity of an algorithm
